/*
Linear Equations
Theorem 2.2.2 also gives a useful way to describe the solutions to a system
Ax = b
of linear equations. There is a related system
Ax = 0
called the associated homogeneous system, obtained from the original system 
Ax = b by replacing all
the constants by zeros. Suppose x1 is a solution to Ax = b and x0 is a 
solution to Ax = 0 (that is Ax1 = b
and Ax0 = 0). Then x1 + x0 is another solution to Ax = b. Indeed, Theorem 
2.2.2 gives
A(x1 + x0 ) = Ax1 + Ax0 = b + 0 = b
